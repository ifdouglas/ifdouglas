## Douglas Fernandes
As a Software Engineer with over 15 years of software development, I am passionate about delivering quality software that enhances the user experience. I have a strong background in UI, UX, SEO, performance optimization and micro-animations. Cutting-edge technologies such as React, Next.js, TypeScript, React Testing Library and React Query are part of my current main stack.

Most of my last jobs were for startups and banking companies, so I have a strong background in the CI/CD processes and all the security measures, issues and responsibilities that a high-end software engineering needs.

Now I own my Software Company: [byhumanoid.com](https://www.byhumanoid.com).
