## Douglas Fernandes
As a Software Engineer with 12+ years of experience in software development, I am passionate about delivering quality software that enhances the user experience. I have a strong background in UI, UX, SEO, performance optimization and micro-animations. Cutting-edge technologies such as React, Next.js, TypeScript, React Testing Library and React Query are part of my current main stack.

I have been working majority of my latest jobs for Banks, so I have a strong background in the CI/CD of this kind of institutions and all the security measures, issues and responsibilities that a high-end software engineering needs.

I also enjoy developing and designing my own apps, which you can find on my personal portfolio: [www.ifdouglas.com](https://www.ifdouglas.com). All my apps are in production, entirely designed and built by me and running for real customers.
