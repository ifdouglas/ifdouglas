## Douglas Fernandes
Over 12 years in Software Development. Front-End heavy. Holding a Bachelor's degree in Information Systems. My main stack today are Next.Js, React and TypeScript. But I also have been using Flutter and AI (ChatGPT, DALL-E) to create useful Apps and GPTs.

Iâ€™m a little obsessed to know how things work. When I face something new, I dive into to understand. I can easily say that this is my best quality. Because I believe that know the core is the key to minimize failures or fast recovery from one.
